# Pyf
Pyf is a very limited python to brainf translater. It has alot of limitations but is still in beta, and is mainly a fun little tool.

## Limitations
It would be easier to say what it can do then what it cant. Well to start all it can convert is:<br>
* Variable setting, but it cant convert setting variables to python functions
* Print statements, can convert printing variables, printing str, bool, int or float conversion aswell. Basically any print statement can be converted which is good
* Input statements, can convert input statements, but not setting variables to an input prompt
* Functions, it can convert functions to valid brainfuck
### More is coming soon!!!
